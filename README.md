# YelpCamp

This web app was built while doing the Web Development Bootcamp 2021 by Colt Steele.

The tools and technologies used for this project were HTML, CSS, JS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB as well as many npm libraries.

This web app is a platform that users can see campgrounds that other users uploaded but also upload their own. The users can upload pictures, make reviews but also watch the location of the campgrounds on a 2D map. All the data are stored on a MongoDB database.
